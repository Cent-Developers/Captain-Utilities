##Version convention:
Please follow this convention in your pull requests!

`1.2.3`

* Here the `1` stands for **`MAJOR`**, this is only changes when there is a HUGE upgrade, I mean a rewrite or a LOT of new commands (like more than 10 or 20).

* The `2` stands for **`MINOR`**, this is changed often but still not as often as the last one, this one is changed when a new category of commands is introduced that doesn't mean a dozen commands in that category, just a category! or a few commands (like 5)

* The last one `3` stands for **`PATCH`**, this is changed most frequently as it represents an addition of 1 or 2 commands.

Thanks for contributing!
